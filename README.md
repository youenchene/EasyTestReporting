EasyTestReporting
=================

I was fed up with messay unit report in jenkins (for UI & Integration testing not unit test). So here it is a quick project to do so.

It's based on static list of my company jenkins job. I will test the Ui for a while then I will do a Jenkins plugin.

Roadmap :
* Manageable list of projects to report.
